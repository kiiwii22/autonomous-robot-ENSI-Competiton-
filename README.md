# autonomous-robot(Robocup Competition 5.0)
Our autonomous robot, "Mrayedh," has been designed to execute six consecutive tasks outlined in the specification book file:

1-Curfew:

The robot detects an open door to take necessary measures.

2-Downtown circulation:

The robot waits for the barrier to be lifted to continue its path.

3-Guess the number:

The robot detects the number of cubes and displays the detected number using LED.

4-Deliver the oxygen tanks:

The robot reaches the large blue square where it finds a rectangular parallelepiped object (the tank). It must bring this object to the small blue square, which represents the unloading area.

5-Clock tower:

The robot stops at the center of the black circle for 5 seconds.

6-Disinfection of the streets:

The robot returns to its initial position.

### The video below showcases the successful execution of the initial two tasks by the robot during the prototyping phase.
